# The Rat Box Experiment

## Concept
A psychological horror puzzle game where the player awakens in a simulated sewer environment, only to discover they're part of a sinister experiment. The game blends environmental storytelling, psychological horror, and puzzle-solving as players navigate an ever-shifting maze while being observed by unseen forces.

## Core Premise
You wake up in what appears to be a decaying sewer system, but something feels... off. The environment reacts to your presence in unnatural ways, and you begin to realize you're trapped in a carefully constructed simulation. As you explore, you'll need to solve environmental puzzles, uncover hidden truths, and ultimately break free from the experiment.

## Gameplay Features

### Environmental Storytelling
- Discover notes, audio logs, and environmental clues that reveal the true nature of the experiment
- Notice subtle changes in the environment that hint at the simulation's artificial nature
- Piece together the story of previous test subjects who failed to escape

### Dynamic Environment
- Shifting walls and corridors that change when not observed
- Lights that activate ahead of the player's path
- Vents and access points that appear too clean, too perfect
- Environmental anomalies that break the illusion of reality

### Puzzle Mechanics
- Light-based puzzles using the flickering environment
- Pattern recognition challenges that test observation skills
- Physics-based interactions with the environment
- Meta-puzzles that require "breaking" the simulation's rules

### Psychological Horror Elements
- Increasing paranoia as the environment reacts to the player
- Moments of isolation and disorientation
- Unsettling audio cues and visual glitches
- The constant feeling of being watched

## Visual Style
- Dark, oppressive sewer environments with industrial elements
- Stark contrast between the grimy surfaces and the too-perfect mechanical elements
- Dynamic lighting that creates shifting shadows and reveals hidden paths
- Visual glitches and distortions that hint at the simulation breaking down

## Sound Design
- Eerie ambient sounds that create tension
- Mechanical whirring and distant, unexplained noises
- Subtle audio cues that guide (or mislead) the player
- Dynamic soundtrack that reacts to player actions and progression

## Player Experience
- A 30-60 minute intense, atmospheric experience
- Multiple endings based on player choices and discoveries
- Increasingly surreal environments that challenge perception
- A growing sense of urgency as the experiment escalates

## Technical Implementation
- First-person perspective for maximum immersion
- Dynamic lighting and shadow systems
- Interactive physics-based environment
- AI-driven environmental changes based on player behavior

## Target Platforms
- PC (Windows)

## Development Roadmap
1. Core mechanics and player movement
2. Basic environment and lighting
3. Puzzle systems and interactions
4. Dynamic environment systems
5. Narrative elements and voice acting
6. Polish and optimization

## Unique Selling Points
- A fresh take on psychological horror in games
- Intelligent puzzle design that ties into the narrative
- A constantly evolving environment that keeps players on edge
- Multiple layers of storytelling that reward exploration

## Inspiration
- *Portal* (puzzle design and testing facility theme)
- *P.T.* (atmosphere and psychological horror elements)
- *The Stanley Parable* (meta-narrative and player choice)
- *Soma* (themes of consciousness and simulation)
