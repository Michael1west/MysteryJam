## Component-Based Architecture

### What is it?
A design pattern where game objects are built by combining reusable components rather than using deep inheritance.

### Example from Code:
```csharp
[RequireComponent(typeof(PlayerState))]
[RequireComponent(typeof(PlayerInputHandler))]
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
```
- **`[RequireComponent]`**: Ensures required components are attached
- **`MonoBehaviour`**: Base class for all Unity scripts
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component handles one specific feature

### Benefits:
- More modular and reusable code
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Better performance through selective updates

---

## Dependency Injection

### What is it?
A technique where an object receives other objects it depends on (its dependencies) rather than creating them itself.

### Example from Code:
```csharp
private void Awake()
{
    state = GetComponent<PlayerState>();
    inputHandler = GetComponent<PlayerInputHandler>();
    movement = GetComponent<PlayerMovement>();
}
```

### Types Used:
- **Constructor Injection**: Not used here (common in pure C#)
- **Method Injection**: Passing dependencies through method parameters
- **Property Injection**: Setting dependencies through properties
- **Service Locator**: `GetComponent<T>()` acts as a simple service locator

### Benefits:
- More testable code
- Loose coupling between components
- Easier to modify or extend functionality

---

## State Management

### What is it?
Managing the different states a game object can be in and the transitions between them.

### Example from Code:
```csharp
// In PlayerState.cs
public bool IsGrounded { get; set; }
public bool IsCrouching { get; set; }
public bool IsSprinting { get; set; }
public bool IsJumping { get; set; }
```

### Patterns Used:
1. **State Pattern**: Each state is a separate class (partially implemented)
2. **State Machine**: Manages transitions between states
3. **Observer Pattern**: Components observe state changes

### Implementation Notes:
- Centralized state in `PlayerState`
- State changes trigger behavior in other components
- Prevents conflicting states (e.g., can't sprint while crouching)

---

## Input Handling

### What is it?
Processing user input from various devices (keyboard, mouse, gamepad).

### Example from Code:
```csharp
// In PlayerInputHandler.cs
public void OnMove(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
{
    state.MoveInput = context.ReadValue<Vector2>();
}
```

### Key Concepts:
- **Unity's New Input System**: Event-based input handling
- **Input Actions**: Abstract input from physical controls
- **Context Sensitivity**: Different behaviors based on input phase (started, performed, canceled)

### Benefits:
- Supports multiple input devices
- Rebindable controls
- Clean separation between input and game logic

---

## Physics and Movement

### What is it?
Simulating realistic movement and collisions using physics.

### Example from Code:
```csharp
// In PlayerMovement.cs
private void Move()
{
    moveDirection = (transform.right * state.MoveInput.x + 
                    transform.forward * state.MoveInput.y).normalized;
    
    float currentSpeed = state.IsSprinting ? 
        moveSpeed * sprintMultiplier : moveSpeed;
        
    Vector3 targetVelocity = new Vector3(
        moveDirection.x * currentSpeed,
        rb.linearVelocity.y,
        moveDirection.z * currentSpeed
    );
    
    rb.linearVelocity = targetVelocity;
}
```

### Physics Concepts:
- **Rigidbody**: Handles physics simulation
- **Forces vs Direct Velocity**: When to use each
- **Frame-Rate Independence**: Using `Time.deltaTime`
- **Collision Detection**: Discrete vs Continuous

### Movement Techniques:
- **Character Controller** vs **Rigidbody**
- **Kinematic** vs **Dynamic** movement
- **Interpolation** for smooth movement

---

## Common Game Patterns

### 1. Update vs FixedUpdate
- **`Update()`**: Called every frame, use for input and non-physics logic
- **`FixedUpdate()`**: Called at fixed time intervals, use for physics

### 2. The Strategy Pattern
```csharp
// Different movement strategies could be implemented
public interface IMovementStrategy 
{
    void Move(Vector2 input);
}

public class WalkingStrategy : IMovementStrategy { ... }
public class FlyingStrategy : IMovementStrategy { ... }
```

### 3. The Observer Pattern
- Used in the input system
- Components can subscribe to input events

### 4. The State Pattern
- Partially implemented in `PlayerState`
- Could be extended with state classes

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Encapsulation
- Use properties with private setters
- Expose only what's necessary

### 2. Error Handling
```csharp
if (groundCheck == null)
    Debug.LogError("GroundCheck reference is missing!");
```

### 3. Performance
- Cache component references in `Awake()`
- Use `[SerializeField] private` for inspector variables
- Avoid `Find()` and `GetComponent()` in Update

### 4. Debugging
- Use `Debug.DrawRay()` for visual debugging
- Add `[Header]` and `[Tooltip]` in the inspector
- Use custom editor scripts for complex components

### 5. Code Organization
- Keep scripts focused and single-purpose
- Use namespaces for larger projects
- Follow Unity's naming conventions
